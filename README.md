## Quick Start

If you prefer to start from scratch rather than using the template:

1. Configure your `_config.yml`:
    ```yaml
    # Theme Settings
    remote_theme: "ChristopherA/BaseTheme@main"

    # Required Plugins
    plugins:
      - jekyll-remote-theme    # Required for remote themes
      - jekyll-seo-tag        # Required for SEO meta tags
      - jekyll-sitemap        # Required for search engines

    # Site Settings
    title: "Your Site Title"
    description: "Your site description"
    url: "https://yourusername.github.io"  # Root URL where site will be hosted
    baseurl: "/your-repo-name"  # Leave empty if hosting at root URL

    # Optional Settings
    navigation:
      - title: Home
        url: /
      - title: About
        url: /about/
    date_format: "%B %d, %Y"  # Default date format for posts

    # Jekyll Settings
    markdown: kramdown
    collections:
      pages:
        output: true
    ```

2. Create your home page `index.md`:
    ```yaml
    ---
    layout: default
    title: Home
    ---

    Welcome to your new site!
    ```

3. Create a sample post in `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` (optional - only if you want blog features):
    ```yaml
    ---
    layout: post
    title: "Your First Post"
    date: YYYY-MM-DD
    description: "Optional SEO description"
    ---

    Your post content here.
    ```

4. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
    Follow GitHub's official guide to [Creating a GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site). Make sure to:
    - Create a new repository
    - Push your files to the appropriate branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`)
    - Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings

5. Optional: Run Jekyll locally:
   SIDENOTE: Personally, I rarely do this, and instead rely on the free GitHub Pages infrastructure.

   To run Jekyll locally, you'll need install Ruby and Jekyll for your operating system:
   - macOS: `brew install ruby jekyll`
   - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install ruby-full jekyll`
   - Windows: See [Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/)

   Then run:
    ```zsh
    bundle install   # Install required gems
    jekyll serve     # Start local server at http://localhost:4000
    ```
   More details for running Jekyll locally are at the official [Jekyll Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

## Required Front Matter
```yaml
---
layout: [default|post]
title: "Page Title"
---
```

## Optional Front Matter
```yaml
---
description: "SEO description"  # Recommended for SEO
date: YYYY-MM-DD              # Required for posts only
---
```
